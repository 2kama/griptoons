                                    Some aspects of our Service may include content that require the redemption of Coins. You may access such content by purchasing and/or earning Coins. You do not own the Coins regardless of whether you have "purchased" and/or "earned" them. Furthermore, Coins do not hold any "real world" value. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive license for personal use of the Coins to access certain content related to the Services.
