                                        Like many websites and apps, GRIPTOONS uses cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (SDKs), and local storage. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish your device from others. Tracking technologies are used by most apps to recognize that a device is the same as one used previously and to understand some of its characteristics so that we can serve you better. This policy explains how we use these technologies, and the choices you have to control them. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, our Privacy Policy applies to the data we collect.

                                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer and devices by us when you use our application or visit our website. They are widely used in order to make the application and our website work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide us with more information.

                                        Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they exist only while your browser/App is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser/app. Other cookies are "persistent cookies", meaning that they survive after your browser/app is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website/app (or visit other websites/apps that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognize the persistent cookies they have set and recognize your browsing device. In any event, GRIPTOONS cookies will not be set for more than 12(twelve) months.
